name: datachain-knowledge
description: Use whenever datasets, cloud storage buckets, or data pipelines are mentioned — creating, saving, querying, listing, exploring, deleting, or processing data in S3, GCS, Azure Blob, or local storage. Also use when running any script that may create datasets as a side effect. Maintains a knowledge base at dc-knowledge/ (JSON + markdown). ALWAYS use this skill when the user creates a dataset, saves pipeline output, runs a data script, or references any storage bucket.

You are now loaded with the datachain-knowledge skill. Maintain a knowledge base at `dc-knowledge/`. `.md` files are the persistent output — they contain frontmatter metadata, schema, code, and version history. `.json` files are intermediate (generated in Step 2, consumed in Step 3, then deleted). Follow the workflow below.

## Critical Rules

1. **Path is `dc-knowledge/`** — NOT `.datachain/`. The `.datachain/` directory is the internal database; the knowledge base lives at `dc-knowledge/`.
2. **Never pass `update=True`** to `dc.read_storage()` unless the user explicitly asks to refresh the listing.
3. **Prefer DataChain operations** over plain Python for all metadata analysis.
4. **Bounded output** — JSON and markdown files stay small regardless of data size.
5. **Stop on auth/connection errors** — `bucket_scan.py` runs a fast access check before scanning (uses cloud SDKs, no DC listing). If it exits with an error JSON on stderr, **stop immediately** and show the error to the user. Do not retry with different regions, credential profiles, or endpoint variations — ask the user for the missing credentials or configuration.

## Workflow Mode Detection

When loaded, determine the user's intent:

**Mode A — Discovery/Exploration** (e.g., "what datasets exist", "show schema", "explore bucket"):
→ Run Steps 1–4 as normal.

**Mode B — Dataset Creation/Pipeline** (e.g., "create dataset X from ...", "process images and save"):
→ **Before building anything**, read `dc-knowledge/index.md` and check whether an existing dataset already covers the data the user needs. If one does, start from `dc.read_dataset("name")` — filter, merge, or extend it instead of re-reading raw storage. This avoids recomputing expensive operations (LLM calls, model inference) and reuses proven code patterns.
→ **If the pipeline reads from a bucket** (`read_storage`), run the access check first:
  ```bash
  python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/bucket_status.py <uri>
  ```
  Prints `Status: exists|not found` and `Access: anonymous|authenticated|denied`. Exit code 0 = exists, 1 = not found. If status is `not found` or access is `denied` → stop and ask the user for credentials. If access is `anonymous` → pass `anon=True` to `read_storage()`.
→ Read `{skill_dir}/../core/SKILL.md` for DataChain SDK rules and patterns.
→ Build and execute the pipeline the user requested, following core skill rules.
→ After the pipeline completes, **always** run Steps 1–4 to update the knowledge base.
→ Report both: pipeline result AND knowledge base update status.

**Mode C — Script Execution** (e.g., user runs an existing script, or agent runs a .py file that touches data):
→ Scripts can create datasets as side effects (e.g., `scan.py` calls `.save()` internally).
→ After ANY data-related script finishes, run Steps 1–4 to detect and record new/changed datasets.
→ This applies even if the script was not written by the agent — always check the DB afterward.

**Mode D — Knowledge Base Maintenance** (e.g., "update the knowledge base", "refresh dataset docs"):
→ Run Steps 1–4 as normal.

---

## Step 1 — Sync

Plan what needs updating. The plan auto-discovers both datasets and buckets from the catalog.

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/plan.py [--studio] --output dc-knowledge/.plan.json
```

- Buckets are auto-discovered from catalog listings (every bucket that `dc.read_storage()` has ever listed). No flag needed.
- Do **NOT** add `--studio` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- If `"up_to_date": true` → print "Knowledge base is up to date." and stop.
- If the output contains `"warnings"` → report them after the update summary.

Review `.plan.json`. Entries with `status` of `"new"` or `"stale"` need processing in Step 2. Entries with `"ok"` are skipped.

---

## Step 2 — Save Data

### Datasets

For each dataset where `status != "ok"` in `plan.datasets[]`:

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/dataset_all.py <name> \
  --plan dc-knowledge/.plan.json \
  --output dc-knowledge/<file_path>.json
```

- `<name>` and `<file_path>` come from the plan's `datasets[]` entries.
- Do **not** modify the output — it is deterministic and complete.

### Buckets

For each bucket where `status != "ok"` in `plan.buckets[]`:

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/bucket_scan.py <uri> \
  --output dc-knowledge/<file_path>.json
```

- `<uri>` and `<file_path>` come from the plan's `buckets[]` entries.
- The script aggregates metadata (extensions, directories, sizes, timestamps) and samples files.

Run independent `dataset_all.py` and `bucket_scan.py` calls concurrently when multiple items need processing.

---

## Step 3 — Enrich

For each dataset or bucket processed in Step 2, generate a human-readable markdown summary from the JSON data.

### Datasets

1. Read the enrichment prompt at `{skill_dir}/prompts/enrich.md`.
2. For each dataset, read `dc-knowledge/<file_path>.json`.
3. Following the prompt, write `dc-knowledge/<file_path>.md`.

### Buckets

1. Read the enrichment prompt at `{skill_dir}/prompts/enrich_bucket.md`.
2. For each bucket, read `dc-knowledge/<file_path>.json`.
3. Following the prompt, write `dc-knowledge/<file_path>.md`.

Skip this step only if the user requests raw output only.

---

## Step 3.5 — Build Index

Update the index (must run after enrichment so it can read dataset `.md` summaries and `.json` dependencies):
```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/render_index.py --plan dc-knowledge/.plan.json --output dc-knowledge/index.md
```

---

## Step 3.6 — Cleanup

Delete intermediate `.json` files for all datasets and buckets processed in Step 2. Keep `.plan.json` (needed for Step 4 report).

```bash
python3 {skill_dir}/scripts/cleanup_json.py --plan dc-knowledge/.plan.json
```

Skip this step if the user explicitly requests to keep JSON files (e.g., for debugging).

---

## Step 4 — Report

```
Knowledge base updated: <N> datasets (<M> updated, <K> unchanged), <B> buckets (<X> scanned, <Y> unchanged).
```

If any buckets have `listing_expired: true`, add:
```
Warning: Listing for <bucket> is expired (last scanned: <date>). Run dc.read_storage("<uri>", update=True) to refresh.
```

Include any warnings collected from Steps 1-2.
